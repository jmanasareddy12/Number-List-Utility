Here’s a clean, resume-friendly README description you can put directly in your GitHub repo. I’ll keep it professional but clear, like something an interviewer can understand quickly.

📘 Number List Utility Tool

A simple Python command-line application that allows users to create and perform operations on a list of numbers.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as:
